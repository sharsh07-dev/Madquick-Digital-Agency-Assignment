### Introduction

This project is a full-stack personal password manager application, built from the ground up as a technical assignment for Madquick Digital Agency. It provides a secure, modern, and user-friendly interface for users to register, log in, and manage their sensitive credentials. The entire application is built with a focus on security, performance, and modern development practices.

### Core Features

* **Secure User Authentication:** Complete user registration and login system powered by **NextAuth.js**, using a credentials-based provider and session management.
* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Logged-in users have full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for their saved credentials.
* **Password Encryption:** All user passwords (for both their account and their saved credentials) are securely hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored in the database.
* **Protected API Routes:** The backend API is protected, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own data.
* **Client-Side Tools:** Includes a robust, client-side password generator to help users create strong, unique passwords.
* **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, responsive interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, featuring:
    * Client-side navigation with Next.js App Router for a fast, seamless experience.
    * Dynamic UI that updates in real-time without needing a page refresh (e.g., after deleting a credential).
    * Clear user feedback for loading states and form submissions.
